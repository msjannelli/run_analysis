Assignment Week 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

There are two files in this repo:
1. run_analysis.R
2. CodeBook.md

##run_analysis
This file includes all the required scripts to download and process the files and then saves teh tidy datasets into the disk:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##CodeBook.md

This file will explain different steps of the script.
